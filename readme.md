 This scenario in which i am  playing the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, i will attack a vulnerable VM within the environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, i will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. I'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.
Then, I will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that i've successfully performed.
